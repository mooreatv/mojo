                         BUILD 15 WORK LIST                      
====================================================================

  1.  Predefined hotkeys added.  These are the first working
      hotkeys in the program.  New classes include
      cFigPredefinedHotkeys, cDlgFigPredefinedHotkeys, 
      cHotkeyTable, cPredefinedHotkeyTable, cPredefinedHotkey.

  2.  bring_cursor_home() added to cMouseover to support new
      "Bring cursor home" hotkey.

  3.  "Broadcast" changed to "Window broadcast."

  4.  "Computer broadcast" and a little bit of supporting code
      added, but it's not implemented yet.

  5.  Virtual function print() removed from cMessage.

  6.  cMessageArrayTarget added.

  7.  cTarget::serialize() and deserialize()added.

  8.  Alternative code path added so incoming TCP messages now 
      buffered and processed by cMessenger's  thread.  However 
      this code path is disabled and the old one used.   The 
      thread's  "wait loop" now waits for both an event and 
      messages.

  9.  WoW icons now get grouped by PC.

 10.  Every Mojo now shows other Mojos' running WoWs.
